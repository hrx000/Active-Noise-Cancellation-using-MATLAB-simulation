# Active-Noise-Cancellation-using-MATLAB-simulation
 The goal of the active noise control system is to produce an "anti-noise" that attenuates the unwanted noise in a desired quiet region using an adaptive filter. This problem differs from traditional adaptive noise cancellation in that: - The desired response signal cannot be directly measured; only the attenuated signal is available. - The active noise control system must take into account the secondary loudspeaker-to-microphone error path in its adaptation.
